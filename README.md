# wifi.sh

A very very minimalistic script to connect your Linux box to a WPA2 access
point.

**You must run this app as root!**

## Dependencies:

* `iw`
* `dhcpcd`
* probably, `firmware-linux`

### Install on debian-based distros

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install iw dhcpcd
$ sudo apt-get install firmware-linux  # If your wireless card needs it.
```

## Troubleshooting

### "It is not working!"

1- This app only works with WPA/WPA2 access points.

2- You must have root privileges.

3- Your system can't have NetworkManager service running (`service
network-manager stop` or whatever command your distro uses).

4- Read the source code (`cat wifi.sh`), understand what it does, research
a little about wireless connections and solve your problem yourself.

5- If nothing else works, install NetworkManager or wicd. Both kind of
sucks, but they use to work well enough for most cases.
